# Online Book Store Project API

## Introduction

Welcome to the Online Book Store API project, a robust solution built using Spring Boot. This platform aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience for managing an online bookstore, catering to both customers and administrators.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project was the growing demand for online stores and the need for a reliable platform to effectively manage inventory, customer orders, and overall store functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot (v3.2.1):** A powerful framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Spring Security:** Ensures application security with features such as authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies the data access layer, facilitating interactions with the database.
- **Swagger (springdoc-openapi):** Enables comprehensive API documentation, easing developer understanding and interaction.
- **Liquibase:** Manages database schema changes and version control.
- **MapStruct (v1.5.5.Final):** Simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Ensures secure user authentication.
- **Docker:** Containerizes the application for consistent and portable deployment.
- **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code through annotations, enhancing developer productivity.
- **Hibernate (v6.4.1.Final):** A robust ORM framework that simplifies database interactions.
- **MySQL (v8.0.33):** A reliable and scalable relational database management system.
- **Java (version 17):** The programming language and platform for building and running the application.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication using JWT for enhanced security.
- **Database Migration:** Leveraging Liquibase for smooth database schema updates.
- **API Documentation:** Utilizing Swagger to generate clear and interactive API documentation.
- **Data Validation:** Incorporating Spring Boot's validation and Hibernate Validator to ensure data integrity.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Spring Boot structure with controllers, services, and repositories. The `src` directory contains the source code, and the `test` directory includes test cases.
